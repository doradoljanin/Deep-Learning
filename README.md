# Deep Learning
## Project 1
Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
<br /> Dataset: CIFAR-10
<br />In this project, we have demonstrated that it is possible to solve the problem of image classification using a very simple architecture with fundamental layers. In addition to that, we tested the MobileNetV3 Large, and obtained an accuracy of 93.51%.
## Project 2
Speech commands classification with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
<br /> Dataset: Speech Commands Dataset
<br /> In this project, we aimed to solve the problem of classifying speech commands using deep learning and recurrent neural networks. We implemented, tested, and compared different network architectures to find the best possible solution.
## Project 3
Image generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
<br /> Dataset: 10% sample of the LSUN Bedrooms Dataset
<br /> In this project, we aimed to solve the problem of generating new images from an existing dataset using deep learning and generative adversarial networks. We implemented, tested, and compared different network architectures, including DCGAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP, to find the best possible solution.
